            MADRID—For Liverpool to claw its way back to a Champions League
            final, one year after losing in one, the club had to play some of
            the best soccer in Europe for a year. It also had to sign the most
            expensive goalkeeper in the world, hold its nerve in places like
            Munich and Paris, and come back from the dead against Barcelona.
          </p>
          <p>
            All told, the team managed by Jürgen Klopp would knock off the
            champions of four other European countries in its own extravagant
            style, just to reach Saturday’s game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then that style went missing. But despite delivering its ugliest
            performance in months, Liverpool somehow emerged from an all-English
            final to become champions of Europe for the sixth time. A pair of
            well-timed goals and a string of diving saves led, in the end, to a
            2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know how Tottenham feels in this moment, maybe better than
            anybody else in the world,” Klopp said. “They would have deserved
            this medal also, but we scored the goals in the right moment.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Each one soothed Liverpool’s recent neuroses a little more. A year
            ago, there was the heartbreaking defeat to Real Madrid in another
            Champions League final that left it with a concussed goalkeeper and
            injured superstar. Less than a month ago, there was the gut punch of
            posting a staggering 97 points in the Premier League and still
            finishing second to Manchester City. Since Klopp arrived in 2015,
            Liverpool had lost three finals.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the final whistle, the team sprinted to the end of the Estadio
            Metropolitano packed with the red-shirted Liverpool fans lucky
            enough to score a ticket. Many thousands more had traveled to Madrid
            without one and poured into the streets of the Spanish capital
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>“This is only the start for this group,” Klopp said.</p>
          <p>
            Though Premier League teams are known for their intensity, the game
            had a strangely subdued quality to it. Perhaps it was down to the
            three-week break between the end of the sides’ domestic campaigns
            and this final showpiece, an unheard of hiatus at this stage of the
            season. Perhaps it was down to the heat in Madrid, where
            temperatures topped 90 degrees on Saturday. But most likely, it was
            down to the manner of Liverpool’s opening goal: a controversial
            penalty kick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just 22 seconds into the game, Liverpool forward Sadio Mané burst
            into the Tottenham area and chipped a ball onto the top of
            midfielder Moussa Sissoko’s arm. The referee didn’t wait long to
            rule in Liverpool’s favor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interpreting the handball rule recently has become one of soccer’s
            thorniest on-field problems following the widespread introduction of
            instant replay to help referees. There are questions of intent and
            of arm position and how much either one matters. Much like the
            question of what constitutes a catch in the NFL these days, the
            number of people who fully grasp the nuances of the handball rule
            might be outnumbered by people who master chemical thermodynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah might have been one of the few people in
            the stadium not asking himself any questions. He picked up the ball,
            drilled it through the middle of the goal and changed the tenor of
            the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any other season under Klopp, Liverpool might have pressed
            aggressively for a second goal. Instead, in a season when it built
            new defensive solidity, the club did the opposite: It sat back,
            absorbed pressure, and trusted itself to keep Tottenham at bay. For
            the most part, it was comfortable work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only in the final 20 minutes did Liverpool have to rely on
            goalkeeper Alisson Becker to bail them out. (It wasn’t the only time
            this season: Alisson’s saves against Napoli and Barcelona were large
            factors in Liverpool reaching the final in the first place.) His
            most impressive contribution was a two-handed plunge to his left to
            parry a Christian Eriksen free-kick, just as Spurs seemed to gain a
            foothold in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tottenham would finish the game with twice as many shots on goal as
            Liverpool.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He looked unbeatable, pretty much,” Klopp said of his goalkeeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Liverpool led for 88 minutes of regulation play, it took
            until the dying moments of the game for the fans to feel certain.
            After all, they hadn’t seen their team play such halting soccer in
            months. But Belgian striker Divock Origi, whose heroics against
            Barcelona in the semifinals were already the stuff of club legend,
            eased their nerves.
          </p>
          <p>
            He lashed home Liverpool’s second goal with two minutes remaining in
            front of Liverpool’s fans, who won’t remember much about the quality
            of the game—only that they were going home with the trophy.
