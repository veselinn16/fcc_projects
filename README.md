# freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

## Description

This is a repository of my projects done, while studying the curriculum section of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
The sections in the curriculum are separated into folders in this repository, so every folder holds the projects, needed to receive the certificate. The topics are as follows:

- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Front-end Libraries
- Data Visualizations
- APIs and Microservices
- Information Security and Quality Assurance
- Coding Interview Prep

## Information about the certificates

Each certificate represents 300 hours of studying the relevant topics, through challenges on the freeCodeCamp site. Each section of the curriculum has its own set of subsections that deals with specific topics, concerning the appropriate skills you need to obtain.
To obtain a certificate, you need to develop 5 projects, based on user stories, which are mandatory. freeCodeCamp provides a script with tests your code must pass in order for a project to be considered successful.
Submission of a project happens by submitting a link to your project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). The CodePen submission must include the test script with all tests passed. My projects on CodePen are available [here](https://codepen.io/dashboard/).
